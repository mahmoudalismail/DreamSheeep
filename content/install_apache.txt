Installing Apache

There are many ways to install Apache on Ubuntu. The three common ways are:
	
	1- Using Synaptic Package Manager (I need more information)
	2- Using Ubuntu Software Center (Go to USC, and search "apache2"
	3- Using the terminal (notice that this is the most common)
		** code box start **
		sudo apt-get install apache2
		** code box end **
		sudo = run program with superuser privilges
		apt-get = program called "Advanced Packaging Tool" (APT) that interfaces with the command-line "terminal" to handle packages
		install = APT command to install or upgrade a package. The name of the package you would like to install is followed by the install command

Notice that once you run the above code in the terminal, the installation process will start and you will be seeing a lot of text/commands/requests in the terminal. If the installation process finishes queitly and you do not see any errors, then apache2 has been installed correctly. If not, then proceed to our **hyperlink starts**troubleshooting**hyperlink end** guide. 

************ END OF PAGE 1 **************

At this point, we expect you have Apache2 running correctly your machine. We will proceed to the Configuration Section where we explain where Apache2 is and how could you configure it.  

Apache2 instanstly runs once it had been installed. To see the web server in action, open your preferable browser and go to ***hyperlink start**127.0.0.1**hyperlink end**. The above IP (Internet Protocol) address is the local IP address Apache is running on. You should be seeing the default "it works" message/page. [We need to include a screenshot]
